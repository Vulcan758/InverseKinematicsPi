# InverseKinematicsPi
This is an inverse kinematic model and code for my 4 dof robotic arm. It it controlled by a PCA9685 which in turn is controlled by a Raspberry Pi. The code is written purely in Python. Massive thanks to [Angela Sodemann](https://www.youtube.com/user/asodemann3) for her amazing videos behind the mathematics involved in inverse kinematics. Without them I probably never would've been able to get to this far.
