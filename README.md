# InverseKinematicsPi
This is an inverse kinematic model and code for my 4 dof robotic arm. It it controlled by a PCA9685 which in turn is controlled by a Raspberry Pi. The code is written purely in Python. Massive thanks to [Angela Sodemann](https://www.youtube.com/user/asodemann3) for her amazing videos behind the mathematics involved in inverse kinematics. Without them I probably never would've been able to get to this far. 

So at a high level, the way this works is pretty simple, it takes x, y, z and configuration input from the user and it later sends this input through a bunch of code that carries out a series of mathematical operations that return the angle at which the first 3 servos should rotate to. The angle at which the 4th servo would rotate to depends on the configuration set by the user. At the moment there are 3 fixed configurations: up, down and zero. Up makes the end effector look up at a complete 90 degrees, down makes the end effector look down at a negative 90 degrees and zero makes the end effector aligned with the servo at 0 degrees.
